\- my name is Alexander,

At the time of writing, I live in Aarhus, where I study and run my small business on a daily basis<a href="https://www.to-be-digital.dk" style="font-family: 'BioRhyme', sans- serif; display: none;" target="_blank">To-Be-Digital</a>.

I'm generally fond of abstraction and system, and I often catch myself trying (for better or worse) incorporating and implementing this in my various interests - whether it's within business and innovation, programming and development or a third project or fascination.

My early childhood and youth took place in Haderslev, where I grew up with my mother and cat, with occasional detours to Varde - first as an boarding school pupil, and later as a conscript.

To make it short, i would likely in my most self-aggrandizing state, describe myself as a curious, mathematical, creative, strategic, forward-thinking & reflective person - with an enthusiasm for calculated risks and eager for the next step.
